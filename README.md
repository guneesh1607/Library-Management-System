# Library-Management-System

# Overview
This Library Management System is a database-driven application designed to streamline and automate the operations of a library. Built using SQL and PL/SQL, this project includes modules for handling book issuance, returns, fine calculation, and transaction history, offering a comprehensive solution for managing a libraryâ€™s records with accuracy and efficiency.

# Key Features

Book Issuance and Return Tracking: Ensures books are issued only if membership and book availability criteria are met, and accurately records due dates and return dates.
Fine Calculation: Calculates late fees based on the difference between the due date and the actual return date, with customizable rates.
